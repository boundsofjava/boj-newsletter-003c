# The Bounds of Java Newsletter
## #3b &ndash; Introducing Combinators &ndash; Part 3

### Outline
This issue of The Bounds of Java Newsletter is the last one of our series about combinators. So far, we've seen what combinators are and how they work, along with a few examples that evince their usefulness. However, we haven't shown how to unleash their maximum power yet. So this final part is dedicated to show how to chain them to create complex flows that can model most usage scenarios.
